# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Analysis goal
The goal of this study is to analyse the viability of **croudfunding a theater** project, particularly a **play**, in the United States with an estimated budget of over **\$10,000**.

##### Data Source
The data-set used contains over 4000 projects from 2009 to 2017, from which 3038 were original from the U.S. This makes our data trustworthy for the purpose of our analysis.

### Findings
First thing we need to find out is how popular our category is among the funded projects, given that a larger sample will provide more robust results.

* In the below chart (_picture 1_) we can check that theater is the most demanded category among the croudfunded projects, a fact also hold in the U.S.

Another definitive point to be taken into account is the outcome of the funded projects depending on the period they were launched.   
* It can easily be checked (_picture 3_) that, independently of the category, the months of May and June are significantly more successful, being December the worst time to start any project. In the case of theater (_picture 4_), this behavior is even more drastic and the spike in May more pronounced, gradually reducing until the end of the year.

Statistically, we have also extracted very useful information to help us group our data in order to limit the risk.
* Mean, median and mode

IQR and standard deviation

### Recommendations

Given the information in the previous section we have some to be aware of
* The fist thing is the time of the year. We have seen how important is the moment where the colletion is started, so it should be planned to be started in May or June, preferably the former, as it is the month when the success hits its maximum among the theater collective. 
* Secondly, it should be **reconsider the requested amount**. The estimated budget is double the pledged amount for plays in US. Having in mind that three quarters of the successfully funded plays have a pledge below \$5700, the amount requested should be decreased to have better chances of dodging failure.
* Moreover, due to fact that the majority of failed projects had very low pledges, there must be other reasons apart from the costly projects that prevents them from success. A further non-numerical analysis is recommended to help finding subtle similitudes among them that could have led to failure and avoid them in current plan.
